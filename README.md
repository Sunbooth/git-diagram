# Election-Simulator (UK General Elections Only)
An A-level Computer Science Project, designed to take election data from an API and compute the result, where the user can apply a series of modifiers to the election to see how these factors did/do affect elections.
In order for this program to work, it requires 'Regionaldata.csv' to be in the same directory with it along with the 'Party Details' folder.  The first provides the demographic data of different regions of the UK which can have their electorate modified.  The latter contains information about the major parties within the election.
This project attained an A grade for it's final mark.
